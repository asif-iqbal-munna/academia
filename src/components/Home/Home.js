        From HomePositron emission tomography, also called PET imaging or a PET
        scan, is a type of nuclear medicine imaging. Nuclear medicine uses small
        amounts of radioactive material called radiotracers. Doctors use nuclear
        medicine to diagnose, evaluate, and treat various diseases. These
        include cancer, heart disease, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or
        neurological disorders, and other conditions. Nuclear medicine exams
        pinpoint molecular activity. This gives them the potential to find
        disease in its earliest stages. They can also show whether you are
        responding to treatment. Nuclear medicine is noninvasive. Except for
        intravenous injections, it is usually painless. These tests use
        radioactive materials called radiopharmaceuticals or radiotracers to
        help diagnose and assess medical conditions. Radiotracers are molecules
        linked to, or "labeled" with, a small amount of radioactive material.
        They accumulate in tumors or regions of inflammation. They can also bind
        to specific proteins in the body. The most common radiotracer is F-18
        fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a molecule similar to glucose. Cancer cells
        are more metabolically active and may absorb glucose at a higher rate.
        This higher rate can be seen on PET scans. This allows your doctor to
        detect disease before it may be seen on other imaging tests. FDG is just
        one of many radiotracers in use or in development. You will usually
        receive the radiotracer in an injection. Or you may swallow it or inhale
        it as a gas, depending on the exam. It accumulates in the area under
        examination. A special camera detects gamma ray emissions from the
        radiotracer. The camera and a computer produce pictures and supply
        molecular information. Many imaging centers combine nuclear medicine
        images with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
        to produce special views. Doctors call this image fusion or
        co-registration. Image fusion allows the doctor to connect and interpret
        information from two different exams on one image. This leads to more
        precise information and a more exact diagnosis. Single photon emission
        CT/CT (SPECT/CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) units can
        perform both exams at the same time. PET/MRI is an emerging imaging
        technology. It is not currently available everywhere. A PET scan
        measures important body functions, such as metabolism. It helps doctors
        evaluate how well organs and tissues are functioning. CT imaging uses
        special x-ray equipment, and in some cases a contrast material, to
        produce multiple images of the inside of the body. A radiologist views
        and interprets these images on a computer monitor. CT imaging provides
        excellent anatomic information. Combined PET/CT scanners perform almost
        all PET scans today. These combined scans help pinpoint abnormal
        metabolic activity and may provide more accurate diagnoses than the two
        scans performed separately. top of page What are some common uses of the
        procedure? Doctors perform PET and PET/CT scans to: detect cancer and/or
        make a diagnosis. determine whether a cancer has spread in the body.
        assess the effectiveness of treatment. determine if a cancer has
        returned after treatment. evaluate prognosis. assess tissue metabolism
        and viability. determine the effects of a heart attack myocardial
        infarction on areas of the heart. identify areas of the heart muscle
        that would benefit from angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery
        (in combination with a myocardial perfusion scan). evaluate brain
        abnormalities, such as tumors, memory disorders, seizures and other
        central nervous system disorders. map normal human brain and heart
        function. top of page How should I prepare for a PET and PET/CT scan?
        You may wear a gown during the exam or be allowed to wear your own
        clothing. Women should always tell their doctor and technologist if they
        are pregnant or breastfeeding. See the Safety in X-ray, Interventional
        Radiology and Nuclear Medicine Procedures page for more information
        about pregnancy and breastfeeding related to nuclear medicine imaging.
